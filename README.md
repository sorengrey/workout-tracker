### Description
Fitness Tracker uses MongoDB and Express to save workouts, along with relevant information such as time, reps, duration, etc. The website is deployed to Heroku, which means there is no installation. The app simply runs in the browser.
<br><br>
On the Dashboard page, the user is presented with color-coded graphs that detail their accomplishments and the balance of workouts they've done.

### Contributing 
This application is admittedly in need of assistance when it comes to using $addField and $sum to add up the duration of multiple workouts. If you'd like to lend a hand, see the contact information below under Questions.
